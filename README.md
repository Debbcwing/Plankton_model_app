# 🌊 Plankton Model App

An interactive Streamlit web application showcasing PhD research on phytoplankton size structure and community dynamics in lake ecosystems.

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://lake-plankton.streamlit.app/)

## 📋 Overview

This application provides an interactive interface to explore research on:
- Size-based phytoplankton competition models
- Grazing strategies and their impact on phytoplankton communities
- Environmental factors influencing plankton population dynamics
- Nutrient regimes and seasonal variations in lake ecosystems

### Key Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered Q&A**: Ask questions about the research and get answers powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using Claude AI
- **📊 Interactive Data Visualizations**: Explore model outputs and simulation results
- **📚 Publication Library**: Access peer-reviewed manuscripts from the PhD studies with downloadable PDFs
- **🎨 Visual Storytelling**: Learn about phytoplankton ecology through infographics
